				<h2>Blog Draft</h2>
				<p class="date">November 22, 2000</p>
				<p>I just have to write this down so it's not in my head.</p>
				<p>Daniel hit me last night.</p>
				<p>He just went crazy. We had been arguing about stupid things; he always thinks I'm in the wrong and he blames me for everything. I said some mean things. I tried to walk away from him to get some space, and he just grabbed me and hit me.</p>
				<p>I had no idea what to do. I just sank to the floor and cried. I told him I wanted to break up.</p>
				<p>He got really nice all of a sudden and started telling me how much he loves me and how it was a mistake and he never meant to hurt me and never would again.</p>
				<p>I just don't believe it. I kept saying I wanted to break up and he kept saying no and got more and more angry. I was scared so I just said ok.</p>
				<p>I just don't know what to do.</p>

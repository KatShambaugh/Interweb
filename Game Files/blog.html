				<h2>First blog post!</h2>
				<p class="date">June 18, 2000</p>
				<p>Hi guys! Yesterday was my graduation from high school; it was a crazy day. The ceremony was pretty boring honestly but then we went out for a delicious dinner and I stopped at Blockbuster to pick up two flicks: I spent the rest of the night with my friends just chillaxing.<p>
				<p>I'm really looking forward to this summer, with no responsibilities. Then college in fall! Wild.</p>

				<h2>Checking in</h2>
				<p class="date">July 1, 2000</p>
				<p>Just checking in with you guys here! Summer is going great even though it has been sooooooo hot. I've really been learning a lot about this website and coding which is so fun. Not sure what else to say so bye for now!</p>

				<h2>I saw X-Men!</h2>
				<p class="date">July 15, 2000</p>
				<p>Yesterday I went to see the X-Men movie in our local theater. Honestly, I wasn't super interested. Superheroes aren't really my thing but my sister loves them so I'm glad she had fun! I love seeing movies on a big screen though, it's so much more fun than on our tv at home.</p>

				<h2>New Netflix movies came in today!</h2>
				<p class="date">July 24, 2000</p>
				<p>We got our two next Netflix dvds today: a nice drama, The Cider House Rules, and a spooky horror film, The Blair Witch Project! I never got around to seeing either of those in theaters last year so I'm psyched to watch them now.</p>
				<p>Netflix rox!</p>

				<p>Today I officially moved into my dorm! I'm a real adult now, not living with my parents any longer!</p>
				<img src="img/blogs/college.gif">
				<p>I have two roommates, Ashley and Jessica, and they are both totally nice. This weekend we are already planning to go party at the frats and hopefully find some cute boys. I'm so excited!</p>

				<h2>Book recs!</h2>
				<p class="date">September 15, 2000</p>
				<p>It's September here and I've been reading some cool classics in my English class. Right now we're reading The Mayor of Casterbridge which really is just like reading a soap opera the characters in it are so wack. If you like that sort of thing, you should read it!</p>

				<h2>FIRST DATE!</h2>
				<p class="date">September 30, 2000</p>
				<p>Last night, I went on a first date with this guy Daniel. I can't believe it! We went over to his place and he made me dinner - pasta with homemade pesto! He's super cool; he studies business here and he's in his third year.</p>
				<p>I'm really looking forward to the second date!</p>

				<h2>Florida with Daniel!</h2>
				<p class="date">October 03, 2000</p>
				<p>So this might sound a little crazy, but Daniel and I went to Florida! That's where his fraternity's semi-formal was and he invited me so we packed up our stuff and off we flew!</p>
				<img src="img/blogs/florida.gif">
				<p>It was such a fun trip: the weather was awesome and we stayed at these beautiful beach houses. The water was so clear! We basically partied the whole weekend and I got to meet lots of his friends, which was super fun.</p>
				<p>I'm feeling great.</p>

				<h2>Meh</h2>
				<p class="date">October 12, 2000</p>
				<p>Today wasn't as great because Daniel and I got into an argument. It came out of nowhere to me: all of a sudden he was just angry at me because he said I was asking for too much of his time. I still feel like I haven't been unreasonable, but I guess he is right. Guess I'll be spending a little more time alone.</p>

				<h2>Fun in the city</h2>
				<p class="date">October 13, 2000</p>
				<p>I got to hang out with my other freshmen friends today! It was nice because I feel like I haven't really seen them in a while honestly. We went out for dinner and just had a chill time.</p>
				<p>I have a lot of homework this week, so that's what I'll be up to.</p>

				<h2>Catskills trip</h2>
				<p class="date">October 23, 2000</p>
				<p>Dan and I went to the catskills this weekeend. Honestly, I'm still really tired so I might come back and write more about it later.</p>

				<h2>Halloween</h2>
				<p class="date">October 31, 2000</p>
				<h3>Halloween is my favorite holiday!!!</h3>

				<img src="img/blogs/halloween2.gif">
				<img src="img/blogs/halloween3.gif">
				<p>Everything is going to be so great today! We're going to a party later tonight and I'm going to be dressed up as Aphrodite with this gorgeous long dress and I'm going to do my hair in nice braids. Daniel hasn't decided what he's going as yet.</p>
				<p>In other news though, today he told me he loved me! I was actually sort of shocked. It's only been a month.</p>
				<p>I didn't say it back yet. Is that weird? It just didn't feel like the right time.</p>

				<h2>Wedding</h2>
				<p class="date">November 4, 2000</p>
				<p>My sister got married! I'm so happy for her and Ben, they're such a great couple.</p>
				<img src="img/blogs/wedding.gif">
				<p>I wish I had the energy to write more but I've been feeling really worn down recently. I guess it's a lot of schoolwork. Daniel and I had another fight. I feel like I can't keep up with what he wants me to be like. I guess I'm trying.</p>

				<h2>Might be taking a break from this</h2>
				<p class="date">November 12, 2000</p>
				<p>Hey guys. I've been slammed with so much work so I'm running out of time to work on this website.</p>
				<p>Plus everytime I want to work, I get all of these calls from Daniel. I don't know what is up with him right now, maybe he's just stressed from school, but he seems to want all of my time. And he always wants to know where I am. It's sort of exhausting. I hope he doesn't see this.</p>

				<h2>???</h2>
				<p class="date">November 22, 2000</p>
				<p>Something bad happened and I just want to talk about it but I can't because this is public. I tried to break up with Daniel, but he somehow got me not to. I'm not sure how it happened. I think I just want to be done.</p>
				<p>I'm going home for Thanksgiving in a few days though and maybe that will help.</p>

				<h2>Nervous</h2>
				<p class="date">November 24, 2000</p>
				<p>I'm really nervous. Daniel doesn't seem to be taking this break up very well. He won't stop calling me. I'm not sure what to do.</p>
				<p>I just want to go home.</p>

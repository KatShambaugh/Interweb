				<h1>Your Calculus Midterm Grade</h1>
				<p>Hello Katie,</p>
				<p>I'm writing because your calculus midterm grade was lower than I expected it to be. I just wanted to check in to make sure everything is going ok. I know that freshman year can be a hard transition for many students, but we have a lot of resources to help you out.</p>
				<p>Please let me know if there is anything I can help you with or if you'd like me to put you in touch with the Office of Student Life for some study help. There will be opportunities for extra credit later in the semester to help your grade.</p>
				<p>Thanks,</p>
				<p>Dr. Weinberg</p>
